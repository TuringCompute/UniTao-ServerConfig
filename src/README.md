# Source Root and Utility Shell Scripts

run python script from this level. this will isolate source code from other README and License Docs
also include Utility Shell command for running python or sub component command

### Utility Shell Scripts

 - req_install.sh :     this will install external libraries base on requirement.txt
 - runpy.sh:            this will add python script path and other necessary environment variable before run python sub command.
                        runpy.sh will also run python script by add python3 at beginning of the command, so we don't need to add the python script title at each script
